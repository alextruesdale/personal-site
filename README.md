# Personal Website
Welcome to the repository for my personal webpage. Here, my website is hosted for its live display at www.alextruesdale.net in addition to being a component of my programming portfolio.
<br>
<br>

## Code
The site is modular, built using Liquid tags and GitHub's Jekyll compiler. Styling is written in SCSS that is compiled via Gulp. Javascript functions are written using primarily JQuery and are compiled in the same way.

## Photography
Photos that are displayed are shot on film in either 35mm or medium format and are a collection of short trips and weekenders throughout Europe. In particular, it was a nice challenge to write my own image gallery code to fit my design ideas.
