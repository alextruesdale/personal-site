# Personal Site
Welcome to the repository for my personal webpage. Building one's own site is a rite of passage that calls beyond the ease of creating a Squarespace page, and I am proud to share mine here! Please take a look around.

## Code
The site is built using Liquid tags and GitHub's Jekyll compiler, especially useful for building a modular website. Styling is written in SCSS that is compiled via the Gulp build system. Javascript functions are written using primarily JQuery and are compiled in the same way.

## Photography
Photos that are displayed are shot on film in either 35mm or medium format and are a collection of short trips and weekenders throughout Europe.
