      - "My interests in business systems and web applications have led me to furiously clattering
        upon my keyboard, sharpening front-end fundamentals and nurturing a budding interest in
        back-end architecture."

      - "A career in cutting-edge tech, however, is just one component to an exciting life; I am also
        drawn to the challenge and experience that comes with living abroad amongst a new culture.
        Combining this and career ambitions, I have spent much of the last year living and working
        in Berlin, Germany."

    text:
      - "At first, I chose Berlin somewhat at random. However, following the expat tradition, I quickly
        developed a fondness for the city, making plans to settle more permanently. Seeking a broader worldview and international
        professional experience, life in Berlin has been rich and rewarding, working with colleagues from all over the world and
        laying the foundation for future ambitions abroad."

    text:
      - "Outside of professional life, film photography is a pleasant change of pace from the digital world."

      - "Unlike when working with code, the live-medium of film allows for a less rigid creative experience where errors
        in process or materials have the potential to produce interesting and unexpected results."
