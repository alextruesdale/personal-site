      - "My interests in business systems and web applications have led me to furiously clattering
        upon my keyboard, sharpening front-end fundamentals and nurturing a budding interest in
        back-end architecture."

      - "A career in cutting edge tech, however, is just one component to an exciting life; I am also
        drawn to the challenge and experience that comes with living abroad amongst a new culture.
        Combining this and career ambitions, I have spent much of the last year living and working
        in Berlin, Germany."

    text:
      - "At first, I chose Berlin somewhat at random. However, following the expat tradition, I quickly
        developed a fondness for the city, making plans to settle more permanently. Seeking a broader worldview and international
        professional experience, life in Berlin has been rich and rewarding, working with colleagues from all over the world and
        laying the foundation for future ambitions abroad."

      - "Outside of professional life, film photography is a pleasant change of pace from the digital world.
        Unlike when working with code, the live-medium of film allows for a less rigid creative experience where errors
        in process or materials have the potential to produce interesting and unexpected results."
