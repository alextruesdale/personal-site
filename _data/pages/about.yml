      - "My interests have always lain someplace in the space between creativity and logic. When I
        was younger, I spent much of my time drawing intricate art pieces in a very meticulous manner,
        spending hours making, re-making, and re-re-making perfectly clean lines and angles."

      - "When searching for a fulfilling careerpath, I've courted, alongside studies at business
        school, disciplines on either end of the spectrum: artist, data scientist, and digital
        marketing guy (of different flavours). With each exposure, professionally or at university,
        I've continued to move toward the center – where business meets technology, where creativity
        meets structure. Though I no longer make the drawings that I used to, I still like working with
        my hands and making beautiful things, which has led me to discover the wonders of programming.
        I have worked in both visual (front-end) and functional (data-processing / analysis) capacities
        with expertise gathered from self-teaching and professional working experience."

      - "A career in business and tech, however, is just one component to an exciting life; I am also
        drawn to the challenges and learnings that come with getting out there – traveling and living
        amongst new cultures. Combining this with career ambitions, I have spent much of the last years
        living and working in Berlin, Germany and am now putting down more permanent roots."

    text:
      - "At first, I chose Berlin somewhat at random. I originally moved here for an internship
        two-and-a-half years ago and have since bounced back and forth between Berlin and Boulder,
        Colorado. Over this time, I grew to feel more comfortable in Berlin, where I've developed
        meaningful relationships, a fondness for the unique city culture, and a feeling of home."

      - "I finished my undergraduate studies in Colorado and decided to move back to this fabulous
        city with the intent to stay. Now, as a master's student in Wirtschaftsinformatik at the
        Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, I look forward to contining to work and study with colleagues
        from all over the world, laying the foundation for future ambitions in Germany and beyond."

    text:
      - "Outside of professional life, film photography is a pleasant change of pace from the digital
        world. Unlike when working with code, the live-medium of film allows for a less rigid creative
        experience where errors in process or materials have the potential to produce interesting and
        unexpected results."
