      - "My interest in business systems and web applications has led to furiously clattering
        upon my keyboard, honing front-end fundamentals and nurturing a budding aptitude for
        back-end wizardry."

      - "A career in cutting-edge tech remains just one component to an exciting life; I am also
        drawn to the challenge and experience that comes with living amongst a new culture.
        Combining this and career ambitions, I have spent much of the last year living and working
        abroad in Berlin, Germany."

    text:
      - "At first, I chose Berlin somewhat at random. Following the expat tradition, however, I quickly
        developed a fondness for the city, making plans to settle more permanently. Seeking a broader worldview and international
        professional experience, life in Berlin has been rich and rewarding, working with colleagues from all over the world and
        laying the foundation for future ambitions abroad."

    text:
      - "Outside of professional life, film photography is a pleasant change of pace from
        the digital world."

      - "Unlike when working with code, the live-medium of film allows for a less rigid process where errors
        in process or materials have the potential to produce interesting and unexpected results."
