      - "A keen interest in the innerworkings of business systems and web applications has led me
        to furiously clattering upon my keyboard, seeking mastery of front-end development
        and nurturing a budding aptitude for back-end wizardry."

      - "However, a career in cutting-edge tech remains just one component to an exciting life; I am also
        drawn to the challenge and experience that comes with living amongst a non-native culture. Combining
        this and career, I have spent much of the last year living and working abroad in Berlin, Germany."

      - "At first, I chose Berlin somewhat at random. Following the expat tradition, however, I quickly
        developed a fondness for the city. Life in Berlin has been an enriching and diverse experience,
        working with colleagues from all over the world while developing my skills and myself."

      - "Outside of professional life, film photography is a pleasant undulgence and change of pace from
        the digital world."

      - "Unlike when working with code, the live-medium of film allows for a less rigid creative experience
        where errors in process or materials have the potential to produce interesting and unexpected results."
