      - "My personal interests have always landed someplace between creativity and logic. In the process
         of searching for a careerpath in which both of these could be expressed, I've explored disciplines at various points on the logic / creativity continuum: artist, data scientist, web developer, digital marketing guy (of different flavours). Each time I tried something new, I moved toward work at the center of this spectrum, where structure and fluidity meet."

      - "At a basic level, I like working with my hands and creating. When I was younger, this was
         through artwork and music. These days, this takes shape in building digital tools of all sorts – some for fun, others professionally, though I try to avoid dsitinguishing the two when possible. I have worked in both web (front & back-end) and data (processing / analysis) capacities with expertise gathered through self teaching, university projects, and professional working experience."

      - "A career in business and tech, however, is just one part of my life; I am also specifically
         drawn to the challenges that come with travelling / living abroad. Combining this with professional ambitions, I have spent the last three years living and working in Berlin, Germany with the intent now to stay permanently after finishing university studies."

    header: Why Move to Germany?
    text:
      - "At first, I chose Berlin somewhat at random. I originally moved here for an internship three
        years ago and then bounced back and forth between Berlin and Boulder, Colorado, finishing my bachelor's studies. Over this time, I grew more comfortable in Berlin, forming meaningful relationships, finding a fondness for the unique city culture, and developing a feeling of home."

      - "I finished my undergraduate studies in Colorado in 2017 and decided to move back to Berlin with
        the intent to build a future here. Now, as a 3rd semester master's student in Wirtschaftsinformatik at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, I am enjoying the challenge of learning both fundamental and cutting-edge techniques in a range of technical areas alongside colleagues from all over the world."

    text:
      - "Outside of professional life, film photography is a pleasant change of pace from the digital
        world. Unlike when working with code, the live-medium of film allows for a less rigid creative
        experience where errors in process or materials have the potential to produce interesting and
        unexpected results."
