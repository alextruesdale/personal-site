    header: Business Analytics & An International Career
    text:
      - "Coming from two years experience in digital marketing, my curiosity in sophisticated business systems
        has led me further to the fields of data science & business analytics. I am fascinated by the
        scalability of programming, machine learning, and the visible impact of data-informed decision-making
        on any given business."

      - "But a career in a cutting-edge field is just one component to an exciting life; I am also drawn to
        the challenges and experiences that come with travel and living amongst a new culture. Combining this
        and career, I have spent much of the last year living and working abroad in Berlin, Germany."

      - "The value of international experience has become clear as my interests grow beyond the borders of
        the United States. A key step to building a unique, global career, life in Berlin has been an
        enriching and diverse experience, working with colleagues from all over the world and laying the
        foundation for further ambitions at home and abroad."

      - "Outside of professional life, I find myself drawn to photography and design."

      - "I like to test my skills in web and graphic design, sharpening development knowledge and building
        webpages â€” like this one. Conversely, with photography, I use only analogue cameras and film.
        Unlike when working with code, the live-medium of film creates a uniquely fallible experience where
        errors in process or materials have the potential to produce interesting results."
